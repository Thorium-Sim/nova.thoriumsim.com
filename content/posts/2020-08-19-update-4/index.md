As promised, I have some starmap work to show off.

This shows the system creation view in Thorium. It's a 3D world which you can populate with whatever systems you want, wherever you want. Additional tools will be added in the future to allow you to measure the distance between stars to make sure travel times in your missions are just right. You can also add a description, which can give hints to the crew or just teach them cool facts about the stars around them. Finally, when I get Factions added, you'll be able to say what Faction controls a system.

Finally, I added a little helper in case you get lost in Thorium Nova.
