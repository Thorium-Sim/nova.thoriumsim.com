This week continued work on the backend systems which will drive movement in the Starmap. Specifically, I worked on modeling the Impulse Engines, Warp Engines, and Thrusters. In fact, this week's essay is the result of some thinking and decisions I've made as I've worked through these problems. I hope you enjoy it.
