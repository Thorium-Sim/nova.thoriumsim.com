excerpt: Work has begun on the overhead Flight Director map

There's been a bit more progress on the star map. I've implemented thruster rotation and activating impulse engines, so ships can now get from one point to another with ease!

I started work on the overhead Flight Director star map. I decided to go with a 3D map that has rotation locked, so you can only look down from above the solar system (by necessity, the Interstellar map will be 3D still). This makes it way easier to place objects in space, since you'll have better control over the Y-depth of objects as you place or move them. You'll also still be able to see the relative depth of objects based on the parallax effect as you move the camera from side to side.
